A quick walkthrough
===================

![Front cover](images/frontcover.jpg) 

A pop-up book is meant to be played with.  This walkthrough only gives
a sense of what the book is and how fun it is for the reader.


# Ring spread

The first spread depicts the entire synchrotron.

The first thing you notice is the ring itself unfolding.  Be sure to
notive the that starts inside the ring and continues onto the interior
wall of the ring.  A synchrotron is an electron storage ring -- this
text explains where the electrons come from.

In the upper left corner is some text explaining how NSLS-II will
operate as a
[user facility](http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/).  Below
that is a spinner which explains how X-rays are generated from the
electron current passing through a
[bend magnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_magnet).

In the upper right corner is a booklet explaining how the
[quadrupole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_magnet) and
[sextupole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextupole_magnet) magnets
work to shape the electron beam, maintaining the small size required
for the world-leading performance of NSLS-II.

In the lower right corner is a pull tab explaining how undulators
gtenerate the extremely intense, laser-light beam of X-rays that make
NSLS-II a unique place to perform scientific measurements with X-rays.
