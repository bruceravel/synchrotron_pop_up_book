Materials used in the NSLS-II pop up book
=========================================

Here we list the materials used in the construction of the first
edition of the pop-up book.  This was a run of about 330 copies which
were hand assembled with most of the work being done over the course
of two weekends in April 2014 by Scott, Linnea, and Bruce along with a
[team](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/blob/master/team.md) of Sarah Lawrence students.

For each part of the book, we had to make decisions about the
materials to use.  While the book can be successfully assembled from
different materials, the following are what we used.  Because one of
the authors is an employee of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, we make this disclaimer:

     Certain commercial equipment, materials, and websites are
     identified in this webpage in order to specify the book
     construction procedure adequately.  Such identification is not
     intended to imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is
     it intended to imply that the materials, equipment, or websites
     identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

In most cases, we provide a link to Amazon for the product we
selected.  Again, this is not an endorsement of Amazon, we provide
this link simply to make clear which product was selected.  We
encourage you to shop around when sourcing materials for making copies
of the book.  Many of these products can be found at
[local retailers](http://www.the350project.net/home.html).

## Main supplies

 * Tear-resistant paper:
   [Rite in The Rain #6511 Duracopy Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XR05G2/).
   This was used to print all papercraft components as well as the
   backing for the interior pages.  The link is to a pack of 25
   sheets, appropriate for a single copy of the book.  It also comes
   in packages of 100.

 * Chipboard used to back the pages of the book:
   [Grafix - Medium Weight Chipboard](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00161W6L8)
   This was an economical choice for bulk construction.  For a single
   copy, you might consider using
   [white chipboard](http://www.amazon.com/Grafix-2-Inch-11-Inch-Chipboard-Sheets/dp/B006YKF9II/).

 * Tape used to construct papercraft and attach items to book pages:
   [Scor-Tape SP202 Scor-Pal Premium, double-sided adhesive tape](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GKTALX6).
   This tape is pretty neat.  It is easy to work with, strong enough
   to hold the book together nicely, but not so sticky that you cannot
   recover from something affixed incorrectly.  The folds in the
   papercraft components of the book have been sized for this tape.
   Although any tape can be used, this stuff is well worth the cost. One roll is sufficient for two books.

 * Clear book tape:
   [3M 1.5" See-Through Book Repair Tape](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IF5Q)
   This was used to attach the chip board pages together after the
   printed pages were taped to the chipboard.

 * Book binding tape:
   [Book Repair Tape- 2 Inch Wide Self Adhesive White](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LQF34G).
   This is the tape we used on the exterior spine of the book.


## Additional supplies

All of these items are more generic than the ones listed above and can
be sourced from any location without changing the quality of the
finished product.

 * Wooden toothpicks were used in the assembly of the spinner which
   depicts the function of the bend magnet.
   
 * Colored paperclips were used to hold the shaping magnet and log
   booklets closed.

 * 1/8 inch 2-56 bolts and their corresponding 2-56 nuts were used to
   assemble the bend magnet spinner and the fluorescence imaging data
   in the log book.
   [Here, for example](http://www.mcmaster.com/#92185a071/=s90nze) are
   1/8 in 2-56 bolts from McMaster-Carr.  These can probably be found
   at any well-stocked hardware store.

 * Normal printer paper was used for the front and back covers and for
   the equipment pouch inserts showing a photograph of the beamlines. If you're just making a single copy of the book and bought a 25 sheet pack of the tear-resistatnt paper, there is no reason not to use that instead.

 * Clear acetate printer sheets were used for the undulator pull tab
   and for the imaging experiment overlays.

## Alternatives

If you don't mind a less durable book or a more difficult construction process, 
but want to use less expensive or more available materials, you can make the following substitutions.

 * Cardstock can be substituted for the tear-resistant paper.

 * Ordinary box cardboard, cut to the right size, can be substituted for the chipboard.

 * Double-stick tape can be substituted for the special tape. If you use the ordinary 1/2" variety, however, you're going to have to cut it in half for many of the applications. Glue (such as white glue) is another good choice. Gluesticks, however, are not recommended--they're not strong enough for most of the components.
 
 * Clear packing tape can be substituted for the clear book tape.
 
 * Electrical tape can be substituted for the book binding tape.
