Build instructions
==================

# Preliminaries
## Step 1

Gather [materials](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/edit/master/materials.md).

## Step 2

Download [pdf files](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/edit/master/pages.md) for the individual pages.

## Step 3

Print. The inserts and front and back cover may be printed on regular paper if desired. Other components should be printed on tear-resistant paper or cardstock. 

Note: some of the pages have two sides, with one file for each side. It is impossible, with any ordinary kind of printer, to ensure perfect alignment when printing two-sided (we tried!). But you should try to get the alignment as good as you can. This usually involves putting a single sheet in the paper tray or feeder, pushed all the way up against the guides on one side (in most printers, there's a little wiggle room), printing one side, and then putting the printed page back in the paper tray/feeder, pushed up against the same guides, and printing the second side.

# Note on Cutting

At some point, you will need to cut out the components for the book, and also cut several slits in the pages. The red lines show you where to cut when it is not obvious.

One good way to make the cuts is to use a utility/hobby knife, or a razor blade. Scissors are not recommended--it's hard, for example, to cut the slits that way. If you have an automatic cutter of some kind, such as are sold for scrapbooking, you can download the [photoshop files](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/edit/master/photoshop.md) and use the cut lines layer to create a template for your cutter.

If you are using a knife or razor blade, we recommend cutting as you go, rather than doing all the cutting first. The instructions below sometimes mention subtleties in how to make the cuts that you might miss otherwise, and it also becomes easy to confuse components such as the different sections of wall.
