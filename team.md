The construction team
=====================

The following students from Sarah Lawrence College were on the build
team for the construction of the first edition of the book.  With their
help we assembled almost 330 copies of the book.  What a great team!

Here's Scott demonstrating a prototype of the book to the group on the first day of construction.

   University of Sheffield who were stuck at the NSLS without beam 
   over the second weekend of construction due to vacuum problems
 * Sue Wirick, Annie Heroux, Mona Rowe, and Matt Cowan who helped
   cross the construction finish line in time for the 2014
   NSLS/NSLS-II/CFN annual Users' Meeting.
