## Life of the electron bunches

        This text is intended to follow a path on the page.  The
        infield of the ring will depict, slightly above scale, the
        linac and booster ring.  The path of text will wend its way
        down the linac, all the way around the booster, down the
        injection line, then around the storage ring.

A laser strikes a diamond (WW anode) to produce a group of (WW
electrons) called a "bunch."

The (WW linear accelerator) increases their energy. 

In the booster ring, the energy of the bunches is increased to
(UU 3 GeV).

Every minute, additional electrons are injected in order to maintain
the ring current at (UU 500 mA), allowing continuous operation for
days.  The stored electrons circle the (WW storage ring), traveling
very close to the speed of light.  As the electrons pass through bend
magents and undulators, (WW X-rays) are created and delivered
simultaneously to all the beamlines at NSLS-II.

## Bend magnet

        The papercraft depiction of a bend magnet is in the lower left
        corner of this spread.  A photo of an NSLS-II bend magnet will
        be printed near the papercraft.

The storage ring is actually a 30-sided polygon. **Bend magnets** at
each corner steer the electron beam between straight sections.
Whenever high-speed electrons (green) are deflected, they generate
X-ray beams (purple) which in the NSLS-II are used for experiments.

This simplified depiction shows a ring made with three bend magnets --
a fourth is implied where your hand turns the wheel.

## Undulator

        The papercraft depiction of an undulator is in the lower right
        corner of this spread.  A photo of an NSLS-II undulator will
        be printed near the papercraft.

An **undulator** is an X-ray source located in one of the 30
straight sections of the ring.  It is an array of dozens of powerful
magnets (with north and south poles shown in blue and red below). 
Each pair of magnets generates
X-rays by deflecting the electron bunches.  The magnets are carefully
arranged so that each pair of magnets generates X-rays that reinforce
the X-rays from previous pairs, resulting in a massive amplification
of the intensity at specific energies.  The energy of the X-rays can
be chosen by adjusting the size of the gap between the magnet arrays,
much like tuning a radio to select a particular station.  An undulator
is to a bend magnet as a laser is to a flashlight.

Pull the tab below to see an undulator cause an electron bunch (green)
to generate X-rays (purple). (Note: In an actual undulator, the electrons 
oscillate perpendicular to the direction shown here.)

## Shaping magnets booklet

        A booklet -- i.e. a two spread book with a stiff top cover and
        bound with tape -- is in the upper right corner of this
        spread.  Opening the booklet to its first spread displays the
        papercraft of a quadrupole magnet.  Opening the second spread
        displays the papercraft of the sextupole magnet.  A photo of a
        magnet girder will be printed near the booklet.
        
        This will be cropped from this photo:
        https://secure.flickr.com/photos/brookhavenlab/5589166111/sizes/l/

As the electron bunches travel around the storage ring, the negatively
charged particles repel one another, increasing the size of each
bunch.  To maintain the small bunches required for proper operation of
the undulators, arrays of shaping magnets are placed around the ring.

A **quadrupole magnet** has four powerful magnets arranged in a ring.
The electron bunches travel through the center of this array of
magnets.  The north and south poles of the four magnets are positioned
so that each electron bunch is compressed as it travels through the
quadrupole.

A quadrupole magnet by itself has a problem.  The electrons in a bunch
are not all of the same energy.  Electrons with slightly more energy
interact with the quadrupole differently than the ones that have
slightly less energy.  This has the effect of stretching the length of
the bunch in the direction of travel, which is bad for the operation
of the undulators.

To correct this problem, every quadrupole is paired with a **sextupole magnet**.  
A sextupole is an arrangement of six magnets in a
ring.  Again, the bunches travel through the center of the sextupole
array and the problem introduced by the quadrupole magnet gets
corrected.  Together these two kinds of magnets, repeated dozens of times
around the ring, serve to maintain the ultra small bunch size required
to make NSLS-II a world-leading synchrotron facility.


# Second spread: Beamline

## Shield wall

        The colored area in the top right corner of the right page
        represents the shild wall.  The transport pipe printed on the
        page extends from the shiled wall to the FOE.
        
        Text on the shield wall with an arrow pointing back toward the
        source.

The shield wall protects people on the experimental floor from
radiation present in the ring tunnel.

This way to the source (undulator or bend magnet)

## First optical enclosure (FOE)

        Near the top of the right page

        The papercraft is a box that unfolds and stands upright.
        "First optical encolsure" is printed on the side.  A cartoon
        of the mirrors and mono is printed on the top of the box.

        A tube labeled "Transport pipe" and printed on the page
        connects the FOE to the end station.

This small room contains the instruments used to process the X-rays
generated by the (WW storage ring) so that they can be used for a
particular experiment at a (WW beamline).  Each kind of experiment has
special requirements.  The **FOE** shown here is typical, although the
various kinds of experiments result in a variety of designs.

The **collimating mirror** removes divergence from the beam so that
all rays exiting that mirror are parallel.  The **monochromator**
filters the light, allowing only the energy required for the
experiment to continue down the beam path.  The **focusing mirror**
focuses the X-ray beam onto a small spot in the **end station**.
That small spot is where the X-ray beam hits the sample!

## Monochromator

        The papercraft monochromator is in the lower right corner.
        The front of the mono, which has artwork making look like a
        mono, is a flap.  This text is printed on the flap.

Lift here for more information about the **monochromator**

        Underneath the flap is the papercraft mono.  On the back side
        of the flap is the following text.

The **monochromator** filters the light generated by the bend magnet
or undulator, selecting just the energy required by the experiment.
For experiments requiring high-energy X-rays, energy selection is
typically made using very pure (WW silicon crystals), although other
materials may also be used.  For lower energy X-rays, a (WW
diffraction grating) is used instead of a crystal.

Both crystals and gratings work to separate a "white" beam of X-rays
into X-rays of different energies.  This is like a prism, which
separates the colors of visible light.  By choosing the orientation of
the crystal or grating, a specific energy of X-ray can be made to hit
the second crystal. The second crystal redirects the X-rays of the
chosen energy towards the end station.  The orientation of the crystal
or grating is computer-controlled, allowing different energies to be
chosen during an experiment.

        The pull tab displays the mono crystals in two orientations.
        The two orientations are labeled "Low energy" and "High
        energy".

## End station

        The end station occupies most of the lower half of the left
        page.  The papercraft component of the end station is two
        walls that unfold to stand upright.  The walls are printed
        with photos of interior and exterior end station walls from
        NSLS-II.

        A photo of an optical table is printed on the "floor" of the
        end station.  This is the surface on which the reader will
        assemble the papercraft experiments.

The end station is where experiments happen.  The equipment in each
end station is specialized for a particular kind of experiment.  It is
shielded to protect researchers from the X-rays within.  An elaborate
interlock system is used to close the end station and make the work
area safe before the X-ray shutter can be opened.

Build one of the experiments from the pouches above!  Each color coded
set of equipment is used to make one of the measurements shown in the
**log book**.

## Instrumentation pouches

        Above the set of pouches, in bold text:

**Instrumentation pouches**

        Each pouch should be colored with the color assigned to its
        experiment.  This color coding connects the pouch to the
        individual instruments and to the pages of the data booklet.
        Each item in the following list is printed on its colored
        pouch.

 * Macromolecular Crystallography (MX) (Color: maroon)
 * Fluorescence Imaging (Color: green)
 * X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy (XAFS) (Color: blue)

## Data booklet cover

        Lower left corner of the right page

        Print the cover of the booklet to look like an experimental
        log book.

        This will be a booklet in the same sense as the shaping
        magnets booklet on the previous spread.  It will have a
        cardboard outer cover and be bound by tape.

        Big, bold text

**Log book**

        smaller text

This book contains results of three synchrotron experiments.  Assemble
each experiment using the contents of an
**instrumentation pouch** then open this book to the corresponding
page to read about the measurement and its results.

        The pages will be color coded to correspond to the experiments

## Experiments

        Each experiment requires text for the instrumentation objects
        and for the presentation of results in the log book

### Macromolecular crystallography

#### Instrumentation

        Printed on the MX pouch

Tiny crystals of a protein or other large molecule are mounted at the
center of the **goniometer**, which rotates the sample in front of the
X-ray beam.  The X-rays scatter from the sample to create a pattern of
spots on the **detector**.  By tracking this pattern as the sample
rotates, the atomic structure of the molecule can be determined.  A
**cryostream** shoots extremely cold gas at the sample, freezing the
sample, and minimizing damage caused by the intense X-ray beam.

Several beamlines at NSLS-II will perform this kind of measurement,
including (BL AMX), (BL FMX), (BL NYX), and (BL SM3).

#### Experiment

        printed in the Log Book near the data

When tiny crystals of a protein are exposed to X-rays,
the rays undergo (WW diffraction), forming a pattern of dots
like the one shown at right, which can be used to determine
the protein’s structure. 

An (WW ion channel) is a passage through a cell wall that allows
only one kind of atom to pass, maintaining a balance of (WW electrolytes)
within the cell. The (WW potassium ion channel) (lift the diffraction
pattern up to see it!) is composed of four copies of a protein linked
in a ring. When a potassium ion enters the pore at one end of the
channel, the proteins change shape in a manner a bit like the paper
model shown on the next page. This shape change transports the ion
to the other side of the cell wall.

Work performed at NSLS (the predecessor to NSLS-II) on this protein
led to the 2003 Nobel Prize in chemistry. A deep understanding of the
behavior of ion channels like this one opens new prospects for the
development of novel pharmaceuticals.

### Fluorescence imaging

#### Instrumentation

        printed on the Imaging pouch

The X-rays entering the end station are focused to a very small spot
by **Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors**. These are plates of glass
polished very smooth and bent along their length. The X-rays graze off
the surfaces of the mirrors and their curvature focuses the X-ray beam
to a spot of (UU 10 um) or smaller.

At NSLS-II, the (BL HXN) beamline will have this imaging capability
with the world's smallest spot of X-rays, (UU 10 nm), a thousand times
smaller than the spot used at NSLS (the predecessor to NSLS-II) for
the experiment shown in the Log Book!  Other imaging beamlines at
NSLS-II include (BL SRX), (BL XFM), (BL TES), and (BL FXI).

A flat sample is mounted where the KB mirrors focus the X-rays. The
X-ray beam interacts with the sample, which then emits X-rays at
energies characteristic of each element contained in the sample. The
**detector** is capable of detecting the intensity and the energy of the
X-rays coming from the sample. In this way, the amounts of different
elements can be measured. By moving the sample back and forth in the
beam, the distribution of elements is turned into an image.


#### Experiment

        printed in the Log Book near the data

The plant (WW *Alyssum*) *murale* is a (WW hyperaccumulator) for the toxic
metal (WW cobalt) -- it can draw cobalt out of the soil and store it within
its leaves. This excess of toxic cobalt is stored at the tip of the
leaf, far away from most of the plant's (WW photosynthetic)
tissues. Additionally, this plant grows star-shaped structures called
(WW trichomes) made from (WW calcite). These hard, mineral structures discourage
animals from wanting to eat the leaves, a survival strategy called (WW antiherbivory).

By measuring the signals from the cobalt and (WW calcium) atoms as the leaf
is moved under the X-ray beam, the distribution of those atoms
throughout the leaf is converted to a colored map. By comparing the distributions 
of the different metals to the visual image (shown in grey), we see the locations of the
metals in the leaf.

{Note that "Alyssum" is currently an entry in Wikipedia, but "Alyssum
murale" is not.  Also note that *Alyssum murale* must be set in
*italics*.}

### X-ray Absorption Fine-Structure (XAFS) Spectroscopy

#### Instrumentation

        printed on the XAFS pouch

In an XAFS experiment, the **monochromator** is used to select a
series of closely spaced energies. The intensity of the resulting
x-ray beam is measured both before (**incident detector**) and after
(**transmission detector**) the beam passes through the sample. The
way in which the absorption depends on the energy of the X-rays can be
used to provide information about the atomic-level structure of the
sample. While often less precise than MX, XAFS is effective on a wider
variety of materials, including those that are not crystalline.

Beamlines for spectroscopy experiments at NSLS-II include (BL ISS),
(BL QAS), (BL TES), (BL XFM), (BL BMM), (BL SST), and (BL SM3).

#### Experiment

        printed in the Log Book near the data

XAFS measurements are made on (WW quantum dots) used to make (WW solar
cells).  The quantum dots in this experiment are (WW lead(II) sulfide)
nanocrystals about (UU 10 nm) in size which convert energy from
sunlight into electrical current.  By tuning the size of the quantum
dot and it elemental composition -- these dots have a small amount of
(WW mercury) -- the properties and efficiency of the solar cell are
controlled.

The X-ray beam passes through the sample and interacts with the atoms
in the quantum dots.  The resulting data is the oscillating waveform
shown here.  This waveform is analyzed to show how the mercury, (WW lead),
and (WW sulfur) atoms stack together to form the quantum dot, leading to the 
ball-and-stick representation you can see at right by lifting the data. 
By understanding changes in how these atoms stack
together, scientists can understand the behavior of the (WW quantum
dot solar cell), leading to better solar cells for commercial products.
