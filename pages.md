Individual pages for printing
=============================

On this page you will find links to PDF files for all parts of the
pop-up book.  These can be printed using a color copier.  You can then
build a copy of the book by following the *cutting instructions* and 
[building instructions](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/blob/master/instructions.md).
Recommendations for paper choice are given below.  See
[our materials page](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/blob/master/materials.md)
for hints about paper choice.
