Build instructions
==================

Note: This is a craft project, not a simple "some assembly required" toy. Think about what you're doing as you make the book, and expect to have improvise a little at times. You may well think of a better way of doing some of these steps than what we've suggested. If so, let us know by raising an issue at the GitHub site -- maybe we'll incorporate it in to a new set of instructions!

# Preliminaries
## Step 1

Gather [materials](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/blob/master/materials.md).

## Step 2

Download [pdf files](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/blob/master/pages.md) for the individual pages.

## Step 3

Print. The inserts and front and back cover may be printed on regular paper if desired. The "Acetate page" must be printed on transparency film. Other components should be printed on tear-resistant paper or cardstock. 

Note: some of the pages have two sides, with one file for each side. It is impossible, with any ordinary kind of printer, to ensure perfect alignment when printing two-sided (we tried!). But you should try to get the alignment as good as you can. This usually involves putting a single sheet in the paper tray or feeder, pushed all the way up against the guides on one side (in most printers, there's a little wiggle room), printing one side, and then putting the printed page back in the paper tray/feeder, pushed up against the same guides, and printing the second side.

# Note on Cutting

At some point, you will need to cut out the components for the book, and also cut several slits in the pages. The red lines show you where to cut when it is not obvious.

One good way to make the cuts is to use a utility/hobby knife, or a razor blade. Scissors are not recommended--it's hard, for example, to cut the slits that way. If you have an automatic cutter of some kind, such as are sold for scrapbooking, you can download the [photoshop files](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/blob/master/photoshop.md) and use the cut lines layer to create a template for your cutter.

If you are using a knife or razor blade, we recommend cutting as you go, rather than doing all the cutting first. The instructions below sometimes mention subtleties in how to make the cuts that you might miss otherwise, and it also becomes easy to confuse components such as the different sections of wall.

# Note on Tape

If you're using the suggested tape from the materials page, you don't need a scissors to cut off strips--you can tear it with your fingers.

# Components for Experiments

The first thing to assemble is the components for the experiments that will go in the endstation, and the pouches to hold them.

## Step 4

Each of the "pouches" sheet has a piece that will form a pouch when cut out and folded--they take up about half the page, and have "Open for...components" on the left flap. One is blue, one is red, and one is green. 

Cut around the outside of these shapes to remove them from their sheets.

## Step 5

Note that each pouch also has two tall narrow ovals, in black, inside the colored rectangle with the text. Cut a slit inside each of these ovals. It is not necessary for the slit to be perfect--you don't need to cut out the entire oval to its border, for example. It just needs to be wide enough to fit the tabs at the left side.

## Step 6

For each pouch, tear off two strips of tape about the length of the small trapezoidal tabs and apply them. For now, don't take the backing off.

![Step 6, apply tape to pouch tabs](assembly/Step6.png)


## Step 7

For each pouch, fold away from you along the lines shown in purple below. This should create an envelope with the writing on the outside.

![Step 7, fold tabs to make pouch](assembly/Step7.png)

## Step 8

Remove the backing from the strips of tape, and seal the front of the pouch to the tabs.

You should now have three pouches. Each can be open and closed repeatedly by inserting the small rectangular tabs in to the slits you made.

## Step 9

Cut the individual cards out of the "Inserts" page. Slide each one in to the pouch with the massing label.

## Step 10

In the next several steps, we're going to make several of the experimental components that go in the pouches. Cut out the following:

* From the One-Sided Components page, the KB Mirrors and the Detector.
* From the Two-Sided Components page, the Silicon Drift Detector, the plant, the solar cell sample, the Optical Camera (labelled 4), and the Goniometer head (the small, grey, unlabeled piece in the lower left).
* From the page that held the imaging pouch, the Goniometer base (labelled b).
* From the Inner Wall page, the Cryostream.
* From the Spinner page, the Incident Detector and Transmission Detector.

## Step 11

Fold the tab on the plant toward you, ans slide the plant in to the green pouch. Fold the tab on the solar cell sample toward you, and slide in to the blue pouch.

## Step 12

The Cryostream and the Optical Camera have a diagonal line to mark where a slit should be. Cut each slit, extended it all the way to the edge.

The Cryostream can now be slid in to the red pouch and the Optical Camera in to the green pouch.

## Step 13

The KB Mirrors, the Detector, and the Silicon Drift Detector are assembled similarly. In each case, there is a small rectangle at one end, about the width of a strip of tape. Place a piece of tape along that length. Next, fold away from you along each of the parallel rectangle sides, so that the object forms a box, with the rectangle with the tape overlapping the bottom of the opposite side. Remove the backing from the tape and press against the overlapping side. Manipulate the resulting box so that the sides are perpendicular. Do not fold the tabs!

Slide the KB Mirrors and the Silicon Drift Detector in to the green pouch and the Detector in to the red pouch. You'll have to flatten them a bit to do that.

## Step 14

The Incident Detector and Transmission Detector are assembled similarly. Place a piece of tape in the empty rectangle as shown. Fold away from you along each line shown, to form a box. Remove the backing from the piece of tape and attach it to the overlapping side. Manipulate the resulting box so that the sides are perpendicular. Fold the tab so that it points out from the box.

Slide the Incident Detector and the Transmission Detector in to the blue pouch. You'll have to flatten them a bit to do that.

![Step 14, XAFS detectors](assembly/Step14.png)

## Step 15

Place a piece of tape along the Goniometer head as shown. Then fold away from you along the line shown (the exact location of the fold isn't crucial).

Remove the backing from the tape and attach to the center of the Goniometer base. It doesn't matter which way you orient it, but you should manipulate the fold so that the goniometer head is sticking straight out of the base.

Place the assembled goniometer in to the red pouch.

![Step 15, Goniometer](assembly/Step15.png)

## Step 16

Close each of the pouches by slipping the tabs in to the slits, and set aside.

# Bend Magnet Spinner

## Step 17

Cut out the remaining pieces from the Spinner page. The scalloped edges of the spinner are not crucial to its function; spend as much or as little effort as you'd like getting those cut prettily!

Note the red oval in the top bend magnet (shown in blue). Cut a slit in that red oval.

Note the red circles in the spinner. Find a way to make each in to a hole. Maybe you can do that with a knife or razor, or maybe it's better to use a needle--let us know what works well for you! (We used a laser cutter for all the cuts in the book, so haven't experimented much with other methods.) Do not make the holes bigger than the circles.

## Step 18

Thread an ordinary round toothpick through the spinner. Using the numbering shown on the figure below, start with the toothpick on the printed side of the spinner, and then push it through hole 1, back out hole 2, in hole 3, and so on. It should fit snugly. If it doesn't, tape or glue it in place, but don't use any tape or glue between hole 4 and hole 5.

![Step 18, Thread toothpick](assembly/Step18.png)

## Step 19

Print Page 1. Note there is a small red circle in the lower left and two red ovals a little right of the center. Make a hole through the circle, and cut a slit inside each oval.

## Step 20

Take one of the small screws, and pass it through hole S in the spinner and then through the hole in page 1 and in to a matching nut. Tighten enough to hold in place, but not so tight that the spinner can't be turned.

## Step 21

Take the X-ray arrow from the Spinner page, and apply a small piece of tape opposite the end with the arrowhead. Slip the arrow through the slit in the blue bend magnet (not the slit in Page 1!) so that the arrowhead is visible in front of the bend magnet and pointing to the right. Take the other end (which has tape on it, right?) and wrap it around the toothpick (which is threaded through the spinner) somewhere between hole 4 and 5. Remove the backing from the tape and attach the end of the arrow to itself, forming a small loop around the toothpick. The idea is that the arrow should be able to slide freely up and down the toothpick between holes 4 and 5.

You should now have a multi-layered assembly. From front to back, you should have the arrowhead, the bend magnets, the tail of the arrow (wrapped around the toothpick), the spinner, and then Page 1. 

## Step 22

Use tape to attach the piece with the bend magnets to Page 1. Because the spinner will be in the way of much of it, those tapes will be limited to a few places on the outer edges of the back of the piece with the bend magnets. In addition, don't use any tape in the top left quadrant except for one piece at the edge of the page, since the toothpick will need to be able to spin freely in that area. 

The result should be that you can turn the spinner using the window in the bend magnet piece at the left, and as you do so the x-ray arrow moves further in or out of the bend magnet. The toothpick should not be visible, and the range of rotation should be limited by a piece of tape so that the toothpick cannot be rotated in to the window.

There's all sorts of places where something could get stuck here--this is one of the places where it's handy to be able to remove the tape from the tear-free paper! Work at it until you're satisfied.

# Shaping Magnets

## Step 23

From the Magnets page, cut out the quadrupole magnet, the sextupole magnet, and the two magnet frames. The quadrupole magnet is the thing with the four copper coils, the sextupole the one with the six coils, and the frames are the colored octagons.

Cut out the white area from the center of the frames.

## Step 24

Put a small piece of tape on the end of each tab sticking out from the magnets, on the **non-printed** side of the paper.

## Step 25

For each magnet, fold it toward you along one of the green lines shown below. Then unfold and fold toward you along the other green line. Unfold again, and then fold away from you along the purple line.

Fold the frames away from you along the purple lines (i.e. fold them in half).

![Step 25, Assemble magnets](assembly/Step25.png)

## Step 26

The yellow frame is for the quadrupole magnet and the orange frame for the sextupole (this is the same color scheme used for the actual magnets at the NSLS-II!).

Remove the backing from the pieces of tape. With the magnet and the corresponding frame both printed side up, place the magnet behind the corresponding frame, so that it's visible through the hole in the middle of the frame. This next step is magic, so read it carefully: attach the tape on the magnet tab to the **non-printed** side of the frame, approximately where the arrows in the diagram above show, so that the small rectangle at the end of the tab just overlaps the frame. 

If you've done everything right, the entire assembly can be squashed flat so that the magnets show nicely through the hole in the frame, but the assembly can also be folded in half, as shown in the animation below {coming soon}.

## Step 27

Cut out the two large rectangular pieces from the text and cover pages. Do not cut out the circle in the middle of the small depictions of the frames!

## Step 28

One side of one of the pieces has text that starts with "As the electron bunches travel..." Place a piece of tape along the tall narrow rectangle next that's to the right of the square which contains that text.

## Step 29

While looking at the piece with the tape on it, fold toward you along the line between the square with the text and the rectangle with the tape.

Fold the other rectangular piece in half, so that it forms a booklet with "A quadrupole magnet by itself..." on the left inside page, "To correct this problem..." on the right inside page, and "A quadrupole magnet has four powerful magnets..." on the front. The back will be blank.

## Step 30

Remove the backing from the tape. Place that  piece so that the large square photograph is on top of the booklet and the small rectangle wraps around it. Press to seal them together with the tape and form a new booklet. The sequence of pages should be the large photograph as a cover, then "As the electron bunches travel," "A quadrupole magnet has four powerful magnets," "A quadrupole magnet by itself," and "To correct this problem."

## Step 31

Because of how they've been folded, each magnet now has been divided in to two large triangular regions opposite each other, and four small ones, which all come together in a point in the center.

Place some tape on the non-printed side of each large triangle. What's "some" tape? Perhaps three pieces roughly outlining the outside of each triangle, but you don't need to be picky.

## Step 32

Open the booklet to the first pair of pages, about the quadrupole magnet. Remove the backing on the tapes on the quadrupole magnet. Center it, with the line between the small triangles pointing along the fold in the page, so that one of the large triangles is attached to the left page, and one to the right. Press down to seal.

Turn the page, and repeat the process for the sextupole magnet.

## Step 33

At first the booklet will be a little hard to close--don't be afraid to press on it a bit to reinforce the folds in the magnets. 

Use a paperclip to hold the book shut (it will bulge--that's OK). Set the book aside.

# Undulator

This is one of the most finicky and precise assembly sequences required for the book. If you have more than one person working on this project, the one who is better with precise craft work should do this part.

## Step 34

Cut the piece that says "pull" out of the Acetate page (the "slider") and the large plain rectangular item with no writing on it (the "sleeve") from the One-Sided Components page.

## Step 35

Place a strip of tape along each long edge of the sleeve. Make sure the tape doesn't hang over the edge, though.

## Step 36

Fold away from you along the lines. If you turn the sleeve over, and push the folded sections nearly flat against the rest of it, you should now have a kind of frame that the slider can slide through. Check the fit--the piece should slide back and forth comfortably, but not have too much room to wiggle from side to side. If it doesn't, adjust the folds you made accordingly. Remove the slider so it doesn't get damaged in the subsequent steps; you'll reinsert it later.

## Step 37

Print page 2. Notice there are two red ovals near the center of the page. Cut a slit in each.

There is also an intricate design in red in the lower right-hand corner. Cut out that design.

There is another red oval just to the right of the design. It is difficult to see in the foliage, but look carefully and you'll find it. Cut a slit in that oval. (If it's still hard for you to find that oval, look at the illustration of the back of the page shown under Step 39.)

## Step 38

Flip over page 2 to the non-printed side. With a ruler, measure 1.5 cm from the bottom edge of the top row of cut-outs and use a pencil to mark a line. The figure below shows where to measure from, and the line (in black) that you should mark.

![Step 38, Undulator alignment](assembly/Step38.png)

## Step 39

At one end of the sleeve, put a piece of tape along one of the short sides. It should be long enough to go under both overhangs. Removde the backing, and seal the overhangs to the main piece on that end. This will create a stop, so that if you put the slider back in the sleeve with the wide end pointing toward the tape, it won't be able to move past it. But don't do that yet.

## Step 40

Remove the backing on the long pieces of tape that you applied to the overhangs in step 35. Turn the sleeve so that the tape faces the non-printed side of page 2, and the stop is on your right. Carefully Line up the top edge of the sleeve with the line you drew; the left edge should go somewhere between the hard-to-see oval and the rest of the pattern, but while top-bottom alignment is crucial, left-right alignment is not. Once it is in position, push the top edge of the sleeve down first, creating a seal. Then stretch the sleeve nearly flat and push the bottom edge down. Because of the folds, the sleeve will curl the page a little bit; that's OK. Push the right edge down; the sleeve is now attached on three sides.

## Step 41

Take the slider and position it so that the word "pull" could be read correctly from the front of the page. Slide the wide end in to the sleeve. Take the end that says "pull" and thread it through the slit in the hard-to-see oval.

## Step 42

Test the undulator assembly!

Turn page 2 back over, so you're looking at the printed side. Hold it in place on a flat surface somehow (eventually, it will be taped to chipboard, but don't do that yet). Pull the slider. You should see green through the center row of holes in the page, and purple through the rows above and below. You should also be able to slide the slider back and forth. See the animation below for what this should look like.

Getting all of this right is, as we said earlier, finicky. It's quite likely the sleeve will not be aligned quite right the first time you try. That's OK--if you're using the tear-resistant paper and the special tape, you can pull the sleeve off of the paper. That will leave behind tape on either the sleeve or the paper, but if you rub at it with your finger you can get it to come off. Once you've done that, apply new tape and try again. Of course, it's up to you how much work you want to put in for the "perfect" result!

Another common problem is that the slider won't go in to the sleeve as far as it should. That usually means that there's a little bit of tape sealing the sleeve prematurely. Try sticking a ruler in to the folds under each overhang, pushing it back and forth to the stop. That will often clear out any obstructions, and if you try inserting the slider again, it may work better.

# Log Book

## Step 43

Cut out the two elements from the Log Book page. Notice that the page with the black and white image of a leaf has a tiny red circle in it; make a hole through that circle.

## Step 44

Fold each down the middle and stack so as to create a booklet with this order of pages: Cover, XAFS Spectroscopy, blank page, MX, blank page, Fluorescence Imaging, page with a black and white image of a leaf.

## Step 45

Use a stapler to staple twice along the fold. 

## Step 46

Cut out the two leaf-shaped pieces from the Acetate page. Cut a small hole in each where the circles indicate.

On the last page of the Log Book, stack them with Calcium one on top. 

Take a small screw and pass it through the holes in the leaves and the page. Use a nut on the other end. Tighten enough so that the leaves can be rotated, but tend to stay in place when they are.

## Step 47

Cut out the piece that says "lift to see structure" from the One-Sided Components page (the "diffraction pattern"). It has a small tilted square in the middle; cut it out and discard to make a hole.

Cut out the irregularly shaped object (the "ion channel") from the Shaping Magnet Text and Cover page. The ion channel has lots of internal cuts indicated by red lines. Try to cut those out, but it is not crucial to get every one or to match them exactly. There is also a tilted square outlined in red in the center; that should be cut out and discarded, to make a hole matching the one in the diffraction pattern.

## Step 48

Place tiny pieces of tape (four 1/4" x 1/4" squares seem to work well) next to the square hole in the ion channel (on the printed side) and remove the backing. Place the diffraction pattern on top with its hole aligned with the hole in the ion channel, and press down. It doesn't matter which way you have the ion channel turned, as long as the hole matches.

## Step 49

Notice that one arm of the protein channel is a little longer and one is a little shorter, with the other two in between.

Put a piece of tape along the end of the long arm. Remove the backing and bend the arm around and attach it to the end of the arm opposite it.

Put a piece of tape along each end of the remaining pair of arms. Bend them around and attach them to the middle of the loop formed by the first pair of arms. See the animation below for how it all fits together.

## Step 50

Put two pieces of tape across the assembly as shown in the photo below. Remove the backing and attach the assembly to the blank page of the Log Book opposite the MX text, oriented so that the "lift" instructions are facing the right way. Push down **hard**.

## Step 51

Test. This element is meant to be pulled up as shown in the animation below. If the tape has all been sealed well, it won't come undone under enough force to stretch open the ion channel. 

## Step 52

Cut out the rectangular piece with "Pb" and "S" on it from the MX pouch page and the remaining rectangular piece from the Shaping Magnets page.

Cut along the red lines of the rectangular piece. Note that the red lines do *not* connect in the top and bottom circles! Likewise, the right part of the middle Pb and the left part of the middle S circles do not get cut. If you do this right, no pieces end up being removed. Instead, these cuts allow you to pull the middle set of circles out from the rectangle. Gently pull them away from the rectangular frame.

Cut out the square that says "life here to see structure" (the "spectrum") from the XAFS Pouch page.

## Step 53

Fold the middle Pb-S pair, and the skinny rectangle joining them, down its middle, away from you. Fold the rectangular frame along the line where the middle Pb-S pair used to be, toward you. The result should be a roughly cubical arrangement, as shown below.

## Step 54

Crease the points where the edges of the cube join the top and bottom circles, so as to improve the look and stability of the cube.

Fold the rectangle leading to the Hg somewhat down, so that the Hg floats in the middle of the cube. You might also want to introduce additional folds in the rectangle leading to the Hg to improve the appearance--the point is to have the Hg legible, and near the midddle of the cube.

## Step 55

Take the rectangle from the MX Pouch page and fold it toward you along the middle of the line joining the Pb and S. 

## Step 56

Put a piece of tape along each of the long edges of the Pb-S rectangle you just folded, on the non-printed side. Remove the backing, and attach it at the "missing" side of the cube. When you are done, there will be a Pb or an S at each corner of the cube (see photo).

## Step 57

On the non-printed side of the spectrum, put a piece of tape along each of the two sided edges and the bottom edge, but not the top edge. Remove the backings.

## Step 57

Carefully close the frame, so that the cube is flattened. The furthest Pb-S pair will stick out from between the two halves a bit. Attach the spectrum on the non-printed side of the frame which is now on top. Notice that there will be some exposed tape from the Pb-S rectangle poking through the holes in the frame; that's why there was no need for a piece of tape along the top of the spectrum.

## Step 58

Turn the frame over. Put pieces of tape along the side and bottom edges (again, some tape should be showing through at the top edge). Remove the backings.

## Step 59

Open the Log Book to the blank page opposite "XAFS Spectroscopy." Attach the assembly you have just made to that page, toward the top, so that there's room for the Pb-S pair that sticks out from the bottom of the frame.

## Step 60

Close the log book and use a paperclip to hold it closed. Set it aside.
