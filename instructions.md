Build instructions
==================

Note: This is a craft project, not a simple "some assembly required" toy. Think about what you're doing as you make the book, and expect to have improvise a little at times. You may well think of a better way of doing some of these steps than what we've suggested. If so, let us know--maybe we'll incorporate it in to a new set of instructions!

# Preliminaries
## Step 1

Gather [materials](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/edit/master/materials.md).

## Step 2

Download [pdf files](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/edit/master/pages.md) for the individual pages.

## Step 3

Print. The inserts and front and back cover may be printed on regular paper if desired. Other components should be printed on tear-resistant paper or cardstock. 

Note: some of the pages have two sides, with one file for each side. It is impossible, with any ordinary kind of printer, to ensure perfect alignment when printing two-sided (we tried!). But you should try to get the alignment as good as you can. This usually involves putting a single sheet in the paper tray or feeder, pushed all the way up against the guides on one side (in most printers, there's a little wiggle room), printing one side, and then putting the printed page back in the paper tray/feeder, pushed up against the same guides, and printing the second side.

# Note on Cutting

At some point, you will need to cut out the components for the book, and also cut several slits in the pages. The red lines show you where to cut when it is not obvious.

One good way to make the cuts is to use a utility/hobby knife, or a razor blade. Scissors are not recommended--it's hard, for example, to cut the slits that way. If you have an automatic cutter of some kind, such as are sold for scrapbooking, you can download the [photoshop files](https://github.com/bruceravel/synchrotron_pop_up_book/edit/master/photoshop.md) and use the cut lines layer to create a template for your cutter.

If you are using a knife or razor blade, we recommend cutting as you go, rather than doing all the cutting first. The instructions below sometimes mention subtleties in how to make the cuts that you might miss otherwise, and it also becomes easy to confuse components such as the different sections of wall.

# Note on Tape

If you're using the suggested tape from the materials page, you don't need a scissors to cut off strips--you can tear it with your fingers.

# Components for Experiments

The first thing to assemble is the components for the experiments that will go in the endstation, and the pouches to hold them.

# Step 4

Each of the "pouches" sheet has a piece that will form a pouch when cut out and folded--they take up about half the page, and have "Open for...components" on the left flap. One is blue, one is red, and one is green. 

Cut around the outside of these shapes to remove them from their sheets.

# Step 5

Note that each pouch also has two tall narrow ovals, in black, inside the colored rectangle with the text. Cut a slit inside each of these ovals. It is not necessary for the slit to be perfect--you don't need to cut out the entire oval to its border, for example. It just needs to be wide enough to fit the tabs at the left side.

# Step 6

For each pouch, tear off two strips of tape about the length of the small trapezoidal tabs and apply them. For now, don't take the backing off.

# Step 7

For each pouch, fold away from you along the lines shown in purple below. This should create an envelope with the writing on the outside.

{Figure Step 7}

# Step 8

Remove the backing from the strips of tape, and seal the front of the pouch to the tabs.

You should now have three pouches. Each can be open and closed repeatedly by inserting the small rectangular tabs in to the slits you made.
