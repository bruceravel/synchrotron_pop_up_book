## Overview

{Upper left corner}

NSLS-II, when fully built out, will:

 * support more than 50 experiments simultaneously, each on its own WWbeamline, with new experiments starting every day as previous ones are completed
 * operate 24/7
 * serve over 4000 visitors each year from around the USA and
   the world, hailing from academia, government, and industry
 * host experiments in chemistry and energy science, life
   science, materials science, earth and environmental science, cultural studies --
   virtually every scientific and technological issue of societal and economic interest will be impacted by NSLS-II

## Electron path

{This text is intended to follow a path on the page.  The infield of
the ring will depict, slightly above scale, the linac and booster
ring.  The path of text will wend its way down the linac, all the way
around the booster, down the injection line, then around the storage
ring.}

A laser strikes a diamond anode to produce a group of electrons called
a "bunch." The linear accelerator increases their energy. In the
booster ring, the energy of the bunches is increased to 3 UUGeV. Every
minute, additional electrons are injected in order to maintain the
ring current at 500 UUmA.  This is called "top-off" and it allows
continuous operation for days.  The stored electrons WW circle storage
ring, traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light.  In this
way, X-rays are delivered simultaneously to all the beamlines at NSLS-II.

## Bend magnet

The storage ring is actually a 30-sided polygon. **Bend magnets** at each
corner steer the electron beam between straight sections. Whenever high-speed electrons (green) are deflected, they generate X-ray beams (purple) which in the NSLS-II are used for experiments.

## Undulator

An **undulator** is an array of dozens of powerful magnets.  Each pair of
magnets generates X-rays by deflecting electrons.  The magnets are carefully arranged so that each pair of magnets generates X-rays that reinforce the X-rays from previous pairs, resulting in a massive
amplification of the intensity at specific energies.  The energy
of the X-rays can be chosen by adjusting the size of the gap
between the magnet arrays, much like tuning a radio to select a particular station. 

Undulators are to bend magnets as lasers are to flashlights.

## Shaping magnets

As the electron bunches travel around the storage ring, the negatively
charged particles repel one another, increasing the size of each
bunch.  To maintain the small bunches required for proper operations
of the undulators, arrays of shaping magnets are placed in many places
around the ring.  

A WW quadrupole magnet consists of four magnets arranged in a ring.
The electron bunches travel through the center of this array of
magnets.  The north and south poles of the four magnets are positioned
so that each electron bunch is compressed as it travels through the
quadrupole. 

A quadrupole magnet by itself has a problem.  The electrons in a bunch
are not all of the same energy.  Electrons with slightly more energy
interact with the quadrupole differently than the ones that have
slightly less energy.  This has the effect of stretching the length of
the bunch in the direction of travel, which is bad for the operation
of the undulators.

To correct this problem, every quadrupole is paired with a WW
sextupole magnet.  A sextupole is an arrangement of six magnets in a
ring.  Again, the bunches travel through the center of the array.
This kind of magnet serves to correct the problem introduced by the
quadrupole magnet.  Together these two magnets, repeated dozens of
times around the ring, serve to maintain the ultra small bunch sizes
needed to make NSLS-II a world-leading synchrotron facility.


[Comments follow:

This is a good photo to print near the magnet objects and could be referred to in the text.

There are 60 (need to verify that number) of these magnet rails in the
lattice, one between each insertion device and bend.  30 bends -> 60
magnet rails -> 120 quad/sext pairs.  Probably beyond the scope of the
book, but there is an interesting story in the magnet rails.  They
were assembled and aligned to micron scale tolerance in a lab almost a
mile away from the ring.  They were transported without disrupting the
alignment and surveyed into place, again with micron-scale precision.
So hundreds of magnets populate the ring, each placed with a few
microns of their proper location around a ring with a circumferance of
about 800 meters.]


Second spread: Beamline
-----------------------


## First optical enclosure (FOE)

This small room contains the instrumentation used to process the X-rays generated by the storage ring so that they can be used for a particular experiment at a beamline.  While each kind of experiment
has special requirements and may have a different compliment of
optics, The **FOE** shown here is typical, although the requirements of various kinds of experiments result in a variety of designs.  

The **collimating mirror** removes divergence
from the beam such that all rays exiting the mirror are parallel.  The
**monochromator** filters the light, allowing only the energy required
for the experiment to continue down the beam path.  The **focusing mirror** focuses the X-ray beam onto a small spot in the **hutch**.

[White light -- and other terms -- too jargony!]

## Monochromator

The **monochromator** filters the light generated by the source (bend
magnet, undulator, etc.), selecting just the energy required by the
experiment.  For experiments requiring high-energy X-rays, energy
selection is typically made using very pure silicon crystals, although
other materials may also be used, while for lower energy X-rays, a
WW diffraction grating is used instead of a crystal.

Both crystals and gratings work like a prism, separating a "white"
beam of X-rays in to X-rays of different energies in the same way a
prism separates the colors of visible light. By choosing the
orientation of the crystal or grating, a specific energy of X-ray can
be made to hit the second crystal. The second crystal redirects the
X-rays of the chosen energy towards the end station. The orientation
of the crystal or grating is computer-controlled, allowing different
energies to be chosen during an experiment.

[Some other things that may be worth mentioning: (1) soft X-ray
beamlines use grating (2) a scattering beamlines may have fixed a mono
(3) other mono crystal materials, Ge, YB66, Beryl, InSb, etc]

## End station

[We need to decide on "hutch" or "end station" and use one consistently. No, they're not quite synonyms, but we don't need to explain both.]

The end station is where the measurement occurs.  The instrumentation
in an end station is specialized for particular kinds of
measurements.  The enclosure is shielded to protect researchers from
the X-rays within.  An elaborate interlock system is used to secure
the enclosure and make the work area safe before the X-ray shutter can
be opened.

Build one of the experiments from the pouches above!  Each color coded
set of equipment is used to make one of the measurements shown in the
**log book**.

## Instrumentation pouches

{Above the stack of pouches, in bold text:}

Instrumentation pouches

{Each pouch should be colored with the color assigned to its
experiment.  This color coding connects the pouch to the individual
instruments and to the pages of the data booklet.  Each item in the
following list is printed on its colored pouch.}

[Need to settle on the color coding.]

 * Macromolecular Crystallography (MX)
 * Fluorescence Imaging
 * X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy (XAFS)

[ Should we fret about color-blind readers?  Perhaps the instruments
and data booklet pages can also be labeled with symbols, for example
Mercury, Earth, and Saturn, from the
[astronomical symbols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_symbols). ]

[We could do it with less clutter by using significantly different fonts, e.g. a serif, a sans serif, and a calligraphy]

## Data booklet cover

{Print the cover of the booklet to look like an experimental log book}

## Experiments

[Each experiment requires text for the instrumentation objects and for
the presentation of results]

corresponding pouch.]
[I switched back to **bold** for consistency with the usage I've employed in the rest of the text]

### Macromolecular crystallography

###### Instrumentation

{Printed on the MX pouch}

A tiny crystal of a protein or other large molecule is mounted at the
center of the **goniometer**, which rotates the sample in front of the
X-ray beam.  The X-rays scatter from the sample to create a pattern of spots on the
**detector**.  By tracking the pattern as the sample rotates, the
atomic structure of the molecule can be determined.  A *cryostream*
shoots extremely cold gas at the sample, minimizing damage from the intense X-ray beam.

Several beamlines at NSLS-II will perform this kind of measurement,
including AMX, FMX, NYX, and SM3.

###### Experiment

{printed in the Log Book below the data}

An ion channel is a passage through a cell wall that allows only one
kind of atom to pass, thus maintaining a balance of electrolytes
within the cell.  The potassium ion channel is composed of four copies
of a protein linked in a ring.  When a potassium ion enters the pore
at one end of the channel, the proteins changes shape in a manner
resembling the action of the paper model shown on the next page.  This shape change
transports the ion to the other side of the cell wall.  

Work performed at NSLS (the predecessor to NSLS-II) on this protein lead to the 2003 Nobel Prize in chemistry.
A deep understanding of the behavior of ion channels like this
one opens new prospects for the development of novel pharmaceuticals.

### Fluorescence imaging

###### Instrumentation

{printed on the Instrumentation pouch}

The X-rays entering the end station are focused to a very small spot
size by **Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors**.  These are plates of glass polished
very smooth and bent along their length.  *Something something
glancing incident* which focuses the X-ray beam to a 10 UUum
spot. [&mu;, not "u", of course]

At NSLS-II, the HXN beamline will have imaging capability. The HXN
beamline will perform this kind of experiment with a 10 UUnm spot, a
thousand times smaller than the NSLS experiment shown in the Log Book!
Other imaging beamlines at NSLS-II include SRX, XFM, and FXI 

A flat sample is mounted at the focal spot of the KB mirrors.  The
incident X-rays interact with the sample, emitting secondary X-rays
at energies characteristic of each element contained in the sample.
The **detector** is capable of detecting X-rays of selected energies, corresponding to particular elements.
In this way, the amounts of different elements can be quantified.  By
moving the sample back and forth in the beam, the distribution of
elements can measured and turned into an image.

###### Experiment

{printed in the Log Book above the data}

The plant *Alyssum murale* is a hyperaccumulator for the toxic metal
cobalt--it can draw cobalt out of the soil and store it
within its leaf.  This excess of toxic cobalt is stored at the end of the
leaf, far away from most of the plant tissue.  Additionally, this
plant grows star-shaped structures made from calcium silicate.  These
hard, mineral-like structures are a survival strategy, preventing
animals from eating the leafs.

By measuring the signals from the cobalt and calcium atoms as the leaf is moved
under the X-ray beam, the distribution of those atoms is converted
to a colored map.  By overlapping the distributions of the different
metals, an image of the leaf structure and composition is made.


### X-ray Absorption Fine-Structure (XAFS) Spectroscopy

###### Instrumentation

{printed on the Instrumentation pouch}

In this kind of experiment, the monochromator is used to select a series of closely spaced energies. The intensity of the resulting x-ray beam is measured both before (**incident detector**) and after (**transmitted detector**) the beam passes through the sample. The way in which the absorption depends on the energy of the x-rays can be used to provide information about the atomic-level structure of the sample. While often less precise than MX, XAFS is effective on a wider variety of materials, including those that are not crystalline.

Beamlines for spectroscopy experiments at NSLS-II include ISS, QAS,
TEX, BMM, SST, and SM3.
