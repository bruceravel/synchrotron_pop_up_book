This folder contains mock-ups of beamline photos to be slipped into
each of the experiment pouches.  The idea is that the photo will help
contextualize the papercraft hutch instruments.

Each photo will be printed two-sided, with the photo on the recto and
an annotated thumbnail on the verso.  Each photo is intended to be
4.75 inches by 2.25 inches, a size that should fit nicely within the
pouches. 

The folder contains all 6 images (recto and verso for EXAFS, MX, and
imaging) in three formats:

   * `.xcf`: the save format for Gimp, which I used to make the
     mock-ups
   * `.png`: for easy viewing
   * `.psd`: Gimp's attempt to export into Photoshop save format
   
   
While these mock-ups aren't bad, there are some shortcomings that make
more sense to fix in Photoshop for consistency with the formatting of
the whole book:

   * Font's are not the same as elsewhere in the book
   * Text (identifying the experiment) color on the recto side is not
     consistent between the three.
   * Lines are not actually arrows
   * Line colors are not consistent between the three.  The beam
     direction line is yellowish in all three, and the lines
     identifying instrumentation are all red-ish.  But I did not take
     care to use the same yellow or the same red.
   * The verso sides have significant white space, which could be used
     for more information....
